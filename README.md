# Open in VSCode

This plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) makes a ribbon button and a command to open your vault as a Visual Studio Code workspace.

You can use VSCode for various purposes with your vault, such as for git version control, markdown formatting with [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode), linting with [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint), [mass formatting files](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jbockle.jbockle-format-files) and more.

The icons work with light and dark mode.

You can also use it as a command and assign hotkeys to it.

## Compatibility

The plugin was tested in Obsidian v0.11.13 and subsequent versions, but probably works with older versions.

## Installation

You can install the plugin via the Community Plugins tab within Obsidian.
You can also manually copy from releases to your `.obsidian/plugins/open-vscode` folder.

## Issues

VSCode can't open a workspace without a further confirmation dialog (that you just can hit enter on) for security reasons. See [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/95670) for more infomation.

## Credits

Thank you to the makers of the [DEVONlink](https://github.com/ryanjamurphy/DEVONlink-obsidian) plugin, as it was a great starting point for working with ribbon icons in Obsidian.
I got the icon from [icon-icons.com](https://icon-icons.com/icon/visual-studio-code-logo/144754) and resized it with [iLoveIMG](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image/resize-svg).
